# dm_zoo

This is used as a subproject for [diffusion-models-for-weather-prediction](https://github.com/ECMWFCode4Earth/diffusion-models-for-weather-prediction).

## Description
This repository contains code to implement diffusion models in [diffusion-models-for-weather-prediction](https://github.com/ECMWFCode4Earth/diffusion-models-for-weather-prediction). 
The following implementations of diffusion models are tested:
- [DiffusionFastForward](https://github.com/mikonvergence/DiffusionFastForward).

## Installation
Installation options will be included in the future.

## Roadmap
This repository is part of a [ECMWF Code4Earth Project](https://github.com/ECMWFCode4Earth/diffusion-models-for-weather-prediction), which takes place between March 1 2023 and September 20 2023.

## Contributing
Script on guidelines for contributions will be added in the future.

## Project status
Under active developement.


## Chapters to be implemented in the future:

### Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

### Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

### Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

### Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
